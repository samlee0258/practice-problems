/*
  You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

  For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the const firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

  Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.
*/

/*
  const lastName = "Lovelace";

  const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
