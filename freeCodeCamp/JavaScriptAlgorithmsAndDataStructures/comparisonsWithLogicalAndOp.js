/*
  Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time.
  The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

  The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if.

  Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the && operator, which will return the string Yes if val is less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 25.
  Otherwise, will return the string No.

/*
  function testLogicalAnd(val) {
    // Only change code below this line

    if (val >= 25 && val <= 50) {
      return "Yes";
    }

    // Only change code above this line
    return "No";
  }

  testLogicalAnd(10);
