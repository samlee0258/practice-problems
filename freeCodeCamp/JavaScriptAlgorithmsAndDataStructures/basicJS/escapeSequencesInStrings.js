/*
  Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string.
  Escape sequences allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to use in a string.

  Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine

You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly.
You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.
