/*
  An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() method.

  The push() method takes one or more arguments and appends them to the end of the array, in the order in which they appear.
  It returns the new length of the array.

  Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.

/*
  const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];

  myArray.push(["dog", 3]);
