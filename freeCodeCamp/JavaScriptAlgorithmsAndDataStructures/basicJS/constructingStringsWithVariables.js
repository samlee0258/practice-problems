/*
  Sometimes you will need to build a string.
  By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

  Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is  and  and I am well!
*/

/*
  const myName = "name";

  const myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
