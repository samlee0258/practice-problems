/*
  Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

  Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do.
  They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

  Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

/*
  // Setup
  let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
  const lastName = "Lovelace";

  // Only change code below this line
  firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line
